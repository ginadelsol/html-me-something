    <h3>Wanderlust</h3>
    <p class="stylin">I like to travel.  I enjoy seeing new geographic regions. I love experiencing new cultures, food, and arts. In August, 2015, I went to Cuba on a group tour and it was fascinating.</p>

    <h4>La Habana Vieja</h4>
    <p class="stylin">Old Havana is a picturesque, historic section of Cuba's capitol. It is a must-see for anyone visiting Cuba.  It has fabulous (often decaying) architecture, historic buildings, restaurants, shops and many strolling entertainers. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

    <h4>Visual Arts</h4>  
    <p class="stylin">Cuba is renowned for its music, and it also has a thriving arts scene.  Visual arts were frequently on display in Havana and the surrounding area.  One artist has his own miniature city not far from the center of Havana where he displays his mosaics on a grand scale.</p>

    <h4>Cars, Cars, Cars</h4>
    <p class="stylin">Of course, no visit to Cuba would be complete without the old cars.  American cars haven't been sold in Cuba since 1959, so it's not unusual to see vintage Chevies, Fords and Buicks tooling around the city.  Many are used as taxis to cart tourists around.</p>
